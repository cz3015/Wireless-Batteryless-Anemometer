# Wireless-Batteryless-Anemometer


This project concerns the development of an existing energy harvesting platform based on a miniature wind turbine into a wireless, battery-less anemometer. Working on this project entails a thorough understanding of a micro wind turbine (MWT) which was developed as a department research project previously in Imperial College London. MWT is used in this project as the sole generator to power the system. The usage of Bluetooth Low Energy allows us to achieve the “wireless” function.
